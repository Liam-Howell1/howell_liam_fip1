<!--
Liam's About Fanshawe website. This website is meant to serve as an overview of some of the things that Fanshawe has to offer to ist students. In this website I have
highlighted a few key points of the college such as the school and study areas, residence, food, FSU, Student wellness and a few other things.

<!--
The website does not have all the copy yet but has a genreal idea of what I want to put into it so I may try to improvise a little bit or will at least describe what will be
in each section.
