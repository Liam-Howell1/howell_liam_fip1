            <p>Fanshawe main study areas are open 24/7 allowing for optimal performance and flexibility when it comes to studying. There are many<br>
                study options to choose from, whether you want to be by the food services in case you get hungry, wellness center for a fitness break<br>
                or just a quiet room to study that is not your dorm, the options are there. Some study areas may be more equipped for what your neeeds<br>
                are depending on classes but thats why there are so many to choose from, and if not studying they are still a great place to hang out.
